# AUC
Ever wanted CUBIC (Custom Ubuntu ISO Creator) but better, less CLI, more GUI? Well then, AUC: Advanced Ubuntu Customizer has got your back! However, it only works with desktop enviroments easy to chroot in, specifically XFCE. You can now create Ubuntu-based Linux distros  via AUC by chrooting into the desktop with only 1 click,  and customize all!
